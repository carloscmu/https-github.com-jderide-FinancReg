We develop a model to study the problem of a social planner who seeks to regulate a financial network in which shocks propagate across firms while she is unsure about the underlying network structure. We derive her optimal policy as a function of investors' attitudes towards risk and ambiguity, firms' information sets, and invariant network characteristics. Our preliminary results highlight the importance of uncertainty and firms' information sets on the optimal policy intervention.
