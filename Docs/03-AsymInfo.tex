\section{Network information asymmetries}
In this section we study the frictions induced in the regulation by information asymmetries with respect to the structure of the financial network.   In this setting, each firm only has partial information about the network.  Moreover, firm $i$ only \emph{knows} \jd{defn need a better verb} its obligations only with its immediate neighbors and, therefore, the optimal capital strategy only foresees capital shocks either idiosyncratic or through one of the directed connected institution.

We extend our model from Section~(\ref{sec:fullinfo}), by replacing the adjancency matrix $A$ and the propagation parameter $p$ with a new matrix, $E$, which represents the \emph{exposure} of each firm with respect to its neighbors.  Thus, $E=(e_{ij})$, where $e_{ij}$ is the level of exposure of firm $i$ with respect to firm $j$ and, in case that firm $j$ receives a shock of $\epsilon$, then the contagion to firm $i$ is $e_{ij}\epsilon$.
