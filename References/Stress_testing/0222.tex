We realize that the only important condition for distress is given by the interaction of each node with its immediate neighbors.  Consider the institution $n$, and denote by $\cN(n)$ the set of its neighbors, i.e., nodes that directly connect to $n$, and let $q_n$ be the probability that institution $n$ faces an idiosyncratic shock.  Therefore, the probability of $n$ entering the distress condition, $D_n$,  is given by
\[\Pro\{D_n\} = q_n p^0_n+\sum_{m\in \cN(n)} \Pro\{D_n|D_m\}\Pro\{D_m\},\]
where the first component of the sum reflects the distress due to a idiosyncratic shock to the institution $n$, and the associated probability of entering distress,  $p^0_n=\Pro\{r_n(1-\epsilon)<\lambda\}$, and the second component is the {\bf network effect}, i.e., the probability of the contagion through the connection to the network.

Using matrix notation, define the matrix $\Gamma_{ij}=\Pro\{D_i|D_j\}$ for each $(i,j)\in E$, and zero otherwise. Then, the probabilities of distress are the solution of the system
\begin{equation}\label{transprob}
P=qp^0+\Gamma\,P\quad \Rightarrow \quad P=(I-\Gamma)^{-1}(qp^0)
\end{equation}

Additionally, this equation imposes implictly conditions over the parameters of the problems such that the solution is a vector of probabilities.  We need to focus our attention to set of parameters such that the matrix $\Gamma$ satisfies the following condition 
\[(I-\Gamma)^{-1}(qp^0) \in [0,1]^N\]

For the CP problem, the expected utility is given by
\[\Ex\{\tilde\pi^*_i(x_i)=\Ex \Ex\{ \tilde\pi^*_i(x_i)|~D_i\}\]
